### Which office, which product and which kind of customer should the company focus its growth plans on? ###

Dashboard 1: 

The area graph shows the significant portion of revenue being brought in by the highest performing office, Paris, while also showing the general downward trend for sales of vehicles in the years in which we have data available. 

The bar chart is weighted for total amount sold / number of customers buying from that office. This shows us that for the amount of customers it has, San Francisco is a high-performing office, and could be a key priority for future growth. 

Overall, these graphs show us that while Paris is the highest selling office, this might also be because the company has the most clients in Paris/Europe. San Francisco and Paris will be key areas of future growth. 

Dashboard 2: 

The same split between which cities perform in terms of revenue and in terms of revenue per customer (Paris and San Francisco) can be seen in these bar plots, which are divided also by the 5 highest selling products. 

This shows us the Ferrari and Mazda models are generally the highest selling products. 

Dashboard 3: 

In terms of what customer profile to focus on, this scatterplot shows us the positive correlation in customers between average spend per order and total spend. The customers who buy the expensive products tend to come back and spend again, bringing their total spend up. 

This shows us that focussing on clients with high average spend per order, and pushing expensive products, will benefit the company, rather than focussing on many smaller sales.
