## STORY

1. First I wanted to see how manny orders we had by year and by country.

2. From that I wanted to find out which products were available and from that found the product lines.

3. From the product lines I wanted to see which ones were the ones on which the costumer spent more monney. And also divided by orders, in avarage depending on the product line how expensive was each order.

4. Then I was curious about how was the organization built and who was in charge of the sales. So I visualized the job titles and how the count for each job. By that I understood that the sales reps were actually the ones moving the monney.

5. So from that I wanted to know who were the top 5 sales reps, how much monney they brought to the company and were did they sale (countries).
