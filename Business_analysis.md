## Project Business Analysis

The aim of this project is to analyse different aspects of a multinational company for the year 2004.I decided to get an approach into Europe to analyse how different metrix have gone through 2004. In this analysis I took a closer look to the orders, customers and finally the products sold by the company in this year.

### Orders in Europe
We can see through the first analysis that the countries with higher orders are Spain with 36 orders, France with 29 orders and UK with 13 orders, three major partners that have grown with us over time.

### Customers in Europe
Following the first analysis I took a closer look to the total number of employees per country in Europe. We can see that France is again the country with more customers with 10, Spain and UK are the second with 5 followed by Italy with 4

### Orders Amount Europe (€)
With this analysis we can see the orders total amount in € for every Country in Europe. We can see that France, is in the first place with a total revenue of 456.954,49 €, followed by Spain with 392.816,49 € and the UK with 230.009,33€. Countries like Austria, Belgium or Sweeden have a low revenue so it would be interesting to analyse this countries in order to improve its revenue.

### Average orders by Country

With the average order analysis I wanted to see if there was a major differnece between countries with the average number of products every time a customer undergoes an order. After the analysis we can see that there's is no major difference between european countries. Again Spain is in top with an average of 36 items, followed by Austria with 35 and France with also 35. On the bottom of the chart we find Ireland with 30 and Belgium with 32. It would be interesting to make a specialized campaign for those countries in order to increase the average product ordered.

### Product Margin

After the analysis by country I focused on the products part. Firstly I wanted to see the margin we were making for every product in order to see wich were the top products and most valuable for the company. We can see that the top products are related with the cars maquetes. Products Margins go from the top product with a margin of 115€ (1952 Alpine Renault 1300), followed by the 2001 Ferrari Enzo with a Margin of 112€. On the lowest part of the chart we find the 1939 Chevrolet Deluxe Coupe with a margin of 10€ and few others with margins between 10 and 20€. It would be an interesting strategy to study if the company really need this products or with this low margin can be taken out of the catalogue and focus the resources in more profitable products.

### Best Selling Products

Again with this analysis I wanted to see the products that were selling better in Europe in the year 2004. We can see that top 10 of the company products go from 1.006.338,42 € to 899.989,05 €. 
On the lower part of the chart products go from 529.860,85 € to 417.499,70 €.
Best selling product is the 2001 Ferrari Enzo. This metric is interesting in order to see if the products on the end have actual value or could be ereased from the catalogue and introduce new ones or focus the resources into more valuable products of the company.
