## Introduction

As every year, we are pleased to see you today to share our current position in the market and to review some of relevant topics along the meeting to ensure that all of us will be aligned in this new commercial year.

Our meeting has been segmented in 4 topics. Here below you can find a summary of them and main insigths found:

**1. SALES REVIEW**

From 2003 to 2005, our revenues stream has been highly unstable. Due to our business subject, we don't have a seasonal line that it would ensure us a stable behavior.

Taking a look into our sales by product line, we can see that Classic Cars is still our top line in terms of revenues. Unfortunately Trains line is not performed as expected so along this year we will take a decision about future of this product line to improve its performance.

Our average sales is very similar in all our offices in different countries and San Francisco has better average.

**2. PERFORMANCE**

Products performance is leaded by Classic Cars line. Its high demand from market push us to keep an excellent stock level to avoid any break that it could impact in our business. Rest of lines are doing well with stock levels protecting our sales chain.

San Francisco has best average sales but in terms of totals, Paris is performing very well with outstanding results every year.


**3. CUSTOMERS** 

Our analysis of customers has been focused on two topics:

    - Dependency: Our business is performing well but has two customers that they can generate a high dependency.
    - Financial strength: Those top customers are consuming our credit constantly. It's normal due to their high level of operations but in case of fail it can put us in trouble.

Thanks for attending.
